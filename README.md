# About

As a Full-Stack software engineer, my journey began in 2015, specializing in Front-End development. My experience spans a dynamic range of industries, including government, finance, e-commerce, and e-sports. With a diverse skillset covering end-to-end product and service delivery, I excel in managing and directly contributing to technology-driven outcomes in Enterprise and Government projects. My hands-on involvement extends to serving prominent companies in Armenia, UAE, and the UK as a Senior Web Developer.

I've played pivotal roles in groundbreaking ventures, including participating an innovative IoT project, 'Moon by 1-Ring: World’s First Levitating Smart Home Hub', in Armenia. I've taken the reins in developing the comprehensive e-sports platform 'win.gg' from inception to fruition. Moreover, I've made substantial contributions to the 'TAMM' project, enriching Abu Dhabi Government Services.

My unceasing pursuit of self-development fuels my passion, and my optimism is a driving force in my interactions. ^_^
